I'm a product designer and traveler based in lovely Williamsburg, NY.

In previous lives, I've worked at Playboy, Food Network and HGTV. I currently work on productivity tools at Google.

This site runs on a hodge podge of technology including [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [Jekyll](http://jekyllb.com) and my own [modified version](https://github.com/elihorne/x/) of [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).

I'm fascinated by the intersection of culture and technology. How people create art, get work done, and navigate their lives. This journal aims to document my thoughts and discoveries.
