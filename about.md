I'm a product designer and traveler based in lovely Williamsburg, NY. I'm currently traveling in SE Asia.

In previous lives, I worked at Playboy, Food Network and HGTV. I now work on productivity tools at Google.

This site runs on a hodge podge of technology including [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [Jekyll](http://jekyllb.com) and my own [modified version](https://github.com/elihorne/x/) of [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).
