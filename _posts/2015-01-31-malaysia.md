This is my second trip to Malaysia in 3 years. The previous trip was my first time in Asia, so I missed some of the details while I tried to acclimate to the time zone and weather.  I did touristy things like visit the Batu Caves (twice) and not-so-touristy things like celebrate Chinese New Year with Liz and her extended family at her uncle's house in Ipoh.

Kuala Lumpur is absolutely exploding with large construction projects. The high-rise condominiums that were going up in 2012 are now finished and occupied, and there are dozens more looming in every direction.  There's an ambitious elevated train system meant to whisk suburban neighborhood residents to the heart of downtown ("KLCC" to the locals), which will bypass the constantly gridlocked traffic.

# Culture
Malaysia is a country made up of three major ethnic groups - the native Malays, Indians, and Chinese.  

## Mamaks and Nyonyas
Mamak is the term, considered a pejorative by some, that Malaysians use to describe Indians who have adopted Malay culture. Nyonya are Chinese whose ancestors immigrated to Malaysia in the 15-17th century, and adopted much of the Malay culture. Technically Nyonya are women and men are Baba, but Nyonya is the catch-all. The offspring of these cultural marriages is incredible to behold.  

The languages are so intertwined that you often hear locals switch between all three in the course of a single sentence. 

It's normal to kick off your morning with a plate full of Indian Roti Canai, grab Chinese Hakka Mee for lunch, and finish with Malay-favorite Nasi Lemak for dinner.  Often, you will go to "hawker stalls", a street food court where cooks rent adjacent workspace, and you walk from vendor to vendor, assembling your courses.

## Cars and Malls
Kuala Lumpur is unlivable without a car. It's almost impossible to walk anywhere in the sweltering heat, and public transportation doesn't really go anywhere other than downtown KL which is just a business district after you've seen the Petronas towers and visited the market on Petaling Street. People invest heavily in their cars - as much an essential tool as a status symbol.  The two major local car brands - Proton and Perodua - are heavily incentivized because import taxes are added to international brands.  A Proton might set you back $12,000 while a Honda Civic costs $32,000. Despite this hurdle, anyone who is anyone drives a fancy imported ride.  It's not uncommon to see several Porches, a handful of Mercedes, and at least 1 Ferrari while you cruise the endless roadways. 

Mostly people stay indoors, cooled by the ever whirring A/C, before piling into cars and driving to the closest (also heavily air conditioned) megamall. You go to the mall to shop, to eat, to hang out.  You even go there for exercise since you can walk blocks at a time without being exposed to the outdoors.  Kuala Lumpur boasts one of the largest malls in SE Asia, as well as a mall shaped like a Pyramid with a giant Lion Sphynx outside. Malls are a big deal.

# Dirt Cheap Data
The last time I was here, I jumped through all kinds of hoops to get a prepaid GSM SIM card, and the reward was slow transfer speeds with poor availability.  This time I easily grabbed a free local phone number (crucial for connecting to wifi networks that will only send activation codes to local numbers) and free access to Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp. For $1.50, you can turn on 1GB of LTE service for 24 hours. This means for $45, you can have 30GB of data a month, without a contract.  Compare that with American wireless providers who charge $80-100/month for far less data.

The free access to Facebook and Whatsapp is particularly clever because everyone I've talked to communicates through family group chats on Whatsapp, and browses the Facebook Newsfeed on an hourly basis.  It's a brilliant growth strategy for Facebook (who also owns Whatsapp).

# Big Android is Big
Phablets (phones the size of tablets) are the preferred handheld device. iPhones are viewed as extremely expensive, and the only ones I saw were a release or two back - iPhone 4 and 5's. The brand of choice seems to be Samsung (who always has a large presence at each mall) or Chinese offerings like Huawei. People are starting to talk about Xiaomi, but I didn't see any in the wild.

# The Itinerary
If you'd like to do as we have, here are the steps to reproduce the experience:

1. Spend a day in KLCC. Get a "hop on, hop off" bus ticket, and see the sights.  This includes the Petronas Towers, Kuala Lumpur Tower, and Petaling Street.
2. Drive to Batu Caves, check out the temples and buy candy for the monkeys.   
3. Drive to Ipoh to see the street art.  Eat Hakka Mee.
4. Drive to Penang and visit Georgetown. See even more street art. 
5. Drive back to KL, hit up some malls for any goods you may have forgotten, and jet out of town.
 
Remember to eat as much as you can.
