#Mui Ne
Our first stop was the tiny fishing village of Mui Ne. Photos will tell you that the bay is chock full of teacup-esque coracle fishing vessels, and a sniff of the air will tell you they make fish sauce with the daily haul. What you have to find out on your own is that Mui Ne is lousy with Russian tourists. Because of direct flights from Moscow, local hotels are terrorized by speedos and techno music. Case in point: our hotel room mini-bar was barren except for 20-ounce bottles of Vodka.

By the pool, we watched a mother photograph her scantily clad daughter for what we could only assume was an application to the Future Mrs. Putin Beauty Pageant and decided to high tail it out of there.

#Dalat
With the salt water fading from the air, we rumbled through unpaved mountain passes until we arrived at a former French Colonial hill station called Dalat. The only casualty was a broken suspension coil, which required fixing before we could proceed. Dalat was a welcome break from the heat and dust of the coastline, although the shadow of Tet was looming ever larger.

We stayed at a bed and breakfast run by a German ex-pat and his kooky sister. While a local shop worked on Mini Mao, we practiced Vietnamese intonations with the hotel staff, and traded tongue twisters in as many languages as we could remember. Dalat didn't have much to offer two road weary explorers other than peace and quiet. One night we stumbled upon a local noodle shop offering "Hoi An Noodles" which were the best thing we'd eaten in days, and it got us excited about moving forward.

#Nha Trang
With brand new suspension holding up the 20kg of luggage and two passengers, we began the long, slow, winding descent back to the coast line. We passed waterfalls and the smoking engines of other travelers whose steeds didn't have the strength to go uphill in the beating sun. Nha Trang, another Russian tourist stronghold, was where we would experience the official Lunar New Year festivities. 

Coincidentally, friends from New York also traveling through Vietnam arrived in Nha Trang at the same time. We excitedly blabbed about where we had been, and then explored the town together. Perhaps too excitedly. I promptly got a mixture of food and alcohol poisoning and spent much of the next 24 hours barfing on the side of the road.

Tet proved to be uneventful. Restaurants closed early to allow their staff to be with family, and the town put on their finest clothes to sit in gridlocked scoot ertraffic listening to local singers belt out traditional tunes. Liz and I bought some sparklers which we lit on the beach. Without much fanfare, the biggest obstacle in our journey was over.

The original itinerary had us halfway to Hanoi by now, so we bought two seats on an overnight train to Hoi An. Vietnamese trains are a trip. Their website time tables seem deliberately cryptic, and they only accept credit cards issued by local banks, so you are forced to appear at the station and stand in long lines. Depending on the direction and popularity of the route, the train will have a combination of cars ranging from cushioned sleepers to hard seats. Sometimes the cars have air conditioning. The hard seats are wooden benches with backs arranged at 90 degrees to the floor. We weren't able to get a sleeping car, but we were very happy to score soft seats. The hitch was that this train didn't have a cargo car, so Mini Mao had to travel by bus.

Just after midnight, we showed up at the train station and climbed into an all-wooden train car from 1975. Locals wore cotton face masks which made sense because the air was about as thick and humid as a sauna. We also discovered once the train started moving that our seats faced backwards. For the next 10 hours, we hurtled through the Vietnamese countryside at what felt like 100 miles per hour, in pitch black. I managed to sleep through most of it, but upon arrival, Liz announced that we would not be taking the train again.
