After 10 days in Malaysia, Liz and I were ready for the first official leg of our SE Asia adventure - Cambodia. I tried to edit my luggage as much as possible in New York, but I still left behind a pair of shoes, and a grab bag of redundant GoPro camera accessories.

Cambodia requires Americans to acquire an "e-visa" so I filled out the form, uploaded a passport photo, and paid $37 USD.  48 hours later, I was good to go so we booked an early flight from Kuala Lumpur to Siem Reap.

We were met at the airport by a tuk tuk driver sent from the hotel. He whisked us down dusty highways, flanked by smiling and waving elementary school students in uniforms.

Siem Reap is known for its Ankor temples built during 800 - 1300 AD, but it's also home to a bustling shopping district and night market, filled with more tourists in hippie pants than you can shake a stick at. Every 5 feet someone asks if you want a ride in their tuk tuk, even though you just turned down 3 other drivers within earshot. American pop music blares from bars while people on the sidewalk try to entice you to eat at their restaurant or to get a 10 minute massage for $1. "Sir, Sir! You want massage?"

We bought 3-day passes to the temples because everyone insists it can't be done with less time. We started with the smaller temples, and worked our way up to the mighty Ankor Wat complex. The temples are beautiful exhibits of ancient cultural anchievements, and the fact that every monument will eventually be reduced to rubble by the unstoppable force of nature.

By the third day, the ruins disappeared into the background for me. All I could see were the throngs of tourists aggressively pushing, stomping, and shouting their way down staircases and through hallways so that they could get the all important "selfie" photo.  I even started collecting these moments, which I've been posting on a tumblr called "Tourists Gonna Tourist." It was time to leave Siem Reap.

We bought bus tickets and arrived in Phnom Penh 7 hours later. Liz and I had intended to stay in the North by the river (where the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers meet) but we somehow ended up in the quite dormant South end of town. Everything we wanted to see was 20 minutes and $5 away by tuk tuk. This meant one thing: we needed our own wheels.

Traffic in Cambodia is very different from the United States. People seem to abide by the basic rule that pedestrians are the lowest class of street organism. Everyone whizzes by on gas-powered vehicles with their horns blaring, and crossing the street is like a game of Frogger.  Traffic lights are more like suggestions than rules, and the way to enter an intersection is to wait for a vehicle bigger than you, so that you can tag along like a nurse fish hugging a shark.

Strangely, I felt right at home. It reminded me of riding a bicycle in Philly as it compares to New York. Sporadic traffic allows for unpredictable behavior whereas in larger cities, we are all like blood cells coursing through a major artery. We have a shared end goal, and we carry the knowledge that sudden stops or turns will surely be met with screeching brakes and the clatter of plastic farings on asphalt.

With our new found freedom, we explored the city. We photographed brutalist apartment complexes next to decadent French villas and perused the junk stalls of the various markets, all while blaring our little horn like locals.

We visited the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a school which had been converted into one of the Khmer Rouge's most notorious prisons. We walked around metal cots decorated only with leg shackles and sidestepped over tiles permanently stained with the blood of previous inhabitants.  Similar to the Nazis, the Khmer Rouge meticulously documented their attrocities. Everyone was photographed and had their height recorded, before they were forced to sign a pre-written confession, often that they were CIA or KGB agents.  

The next day we drove out to the killing fields at Choeung Ek. We were given headphones which narrated details about the mass graves containing hundreds of people. We were told that the staff periodically walks the grounds to collect the bones and teeth that have risen to the surface after heavy rains, and that we should take care not to step on any human remains. We were also shown the "killing tree," where babies had their heads smashed before being tossed into the same grave as their mothers. Because bullets were expensive, people were hit with blunt objects, had their throats slit, and were doused with DDT to finish the job. It also helped hide the smell. To prevent nearby farmers from figuring out what was happening, murders were done under the cover of darkness. The screams were drowned out by megaphones blaring Cambodian folk music set to the dull roar of diesel generators.

I didn't take any photos of Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek because I wanted to be present in the moment. If you are interested in seeing these locations, every inch has been catalogued by other visitors and those photographs are available online.

What happened here is shocking and saddening in any era, but I kept thinking how recently all this took place. I can recall seeing the headlines when Pol Pot died. I felt nauseaus and wandered Phnom Penh wondering how a country moves past something like this. The only anwer I could come up with is that you preserve these locations to educate the world, and try to prevent it from happening again. That sometimes the only way out is forward.

Cambodia was not all sadness. We saw a rapidly developing economy finding its place in the modern world. We ate at a restaurant training young Cambodians how to cook almost forgotten recipes as well as contemporary creative cuisine. We visited gift shops filled with handmade goods sold by women rescued from the sex worker industry.

After 9 days, we were ready to move on. Next stop: Vietnam.

# The Itinerary
If you'd like to do as we have, here are the steps to reproduce the experience:

1. Fly in to Siem Reap. Get the e-visa online - it's easy and faster than doing it on arrival.
2. Get a room at one of the many nice and inexpensive boutique hotels walking distance from "Pub Street."
3. Get a 3-day pass to the Ankor Wat temples, and start with the outer loop of smaller temples. On your last day, go see the sun rise at Ankor Wat.
4. Take a Giant Ibis bus to Phnom Penh. It's the nicest of the bus lines and the seats have power outlets.  The bus prides itself on not having bathrooms, which will make sense.
5. Get a room at a hotel in the North close to the river. We regretted our sleepy location.
6. Rent a scooter and visit all the markets. Central market is impressive, but so is the Russian market
7. Drive out to Choeung Ek and Tuol Sleng and learn about the Khmer Rouge
