#Hoi An
The train arrived in Da Nang, which is the biggest city in central Vietnam, but our target was Hoi An, a quaint town 30 minutes south. We stayed one night in Da Nang, exploring street markets and eating delicious Banh Mi Ga.

The next morning we hired a taxi to take us to Hoi An. I like to think that I have a pretty solid resistance to car sickness. I've spent hours on bumpy roads while crossing the Serengeti, and I've resisted the urge to barf while lurching over canyons inside Mexican tour buses. This particular cab driver almost made me lose my cookies.  His cruising speed was somewhere around 60 miles per hour, regardless of highway or residential city street. Most of the trip was spent driving against oncoming traffic as he tried to pass other vehicles, sometimes coming so close that I found myself clenching my butt checks and gripping the overhead handhold, praying for it to end. 

Hoi An itself is as quaint and beautiful as you would expect from a UNESCO world heritage site. Well kept "shop house" buildings remain in use - now hawking silk goods and custom clothing. For $100 you can get a tailored suit made to your specifications, ready the next day.

Local kids on dates took selfie photos on the various picturesque bridges, and competed in carnival style games to impress each other. We stayed just far enough outside of town that when it was time to sleep, the pop music blasting loudspeakers were out of earshot.

Since trains were no longer being considered for transportation, but feeling like our time in Vietnam was coming to an end, we bought plane tickets to Hanoi and arranged for Mini Mao to be transported by bus once again.

#Hanoi
Finally, Hanoi. The finish line to our adventure in this country. The guide books promised beer cheaper than water and delicious food on every corner.  The beer promise was fulfilled: at a nearby "Bia Hoi Corner", nestled in the heart of the backpacker area, we found mugs of fresh draught beer for 25 cents. The food, on the other hand, was a disappointment. We were unable to find several of the recommended restaurants. After choosing a random Pho restaurant out of desperation, Liz promptly got food poisoning.

We decided to go on one last adventure. Located 3 hours outside of Hanoi are the emerald green waters of Ha Long Bay. We booked an overnight stay on one of the "junk boats" that patrol the area. With barely a minute wasted, the guides and crew puttered over to the natural caves and not-so-natural beaches that can be found there. They lowered kayaks into the water and sent us under cliff overhangs to throw food at wild monkeys, and then raced back to the marina so we could get in our shuttles before the next passengers boarded.

There was one big task left: sell Mini Mao. When I bought the bike, the story was that these machines are bought and sold for a consistent $250. The reality is that Saigon had a sellers market with Tet advancing, and Hanoi was now flush with tourists desperately trying to unload their vehicles. I posted an ad on the local craigslist equivalents, only to watch the listing disappear off the front page, pushed down by dozens of other offerings. I went from $250 to $200 to $150 in a matter of hours without a single bite. Finally, I used the lobby computer to print advertisements which I taped to the front and back of my shirt. I walked back to the "Bia Hoi Corner" where several people made offers on the bike and a couple people congratulated me on the great, if not embarassing, idea.

With hours to go before our flight to Laos, I unloaded Mini Mao to a group of locals. A bit of a hassle, but a hell of a story.
