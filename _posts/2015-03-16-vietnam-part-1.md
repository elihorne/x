The original idea was to start in Thailand, and then work our way clockwise - Myanmar to Laos to Vietnam to Cambodia. As logistics and visas started to gel, we changed course abruptly. We skipped over Thailand by flying directly to Cambodia, and then crossed into Vietnam a week later. The 20 days that followed were unlike anything we could have expected.

To set the scene, Vietnam's population feels very young. The median age is 27, compared to the USA's 37. We were told that 95% of families own at least 1 scooter, and very few can afford cars. French Colonial architecture still lines the streets, but its been remixed under layers of textured paint and bright signage. Additions are bolted on to every available surface, extending out as far as possible without touching the cobwebs of powerlines that drape over the sidewalk.

#Saigon
Saigon, officially known as Ho Chi Minh City or HCMC, is the biggest city in Vietnam. It makes Phnom Penh feel like a suburb. If Cambodian traffic flowed predictably like blood supporting a body, Vietnamese traffic gushed like a river overflowing its banks. Traffic lights were still suggestions, but now sidewalks and curbs were treated like access roads. And the horns. Let me tell you about the horns. If there was one constant in this country, it was the unpausing, relentlessly irritating sound of vehicles honking at each other for no reason other than to confirm their existence.  MEEEEP.

I won't attempt to explain the Vietnam War (or as the Vietnamese say, the "American War"). I've read the textbooks and watched the movies. I also have my own coloring. My mom used to play me old crackling cassette tapes that her brother, my uncle, recorded of his own voice while deployed overseas. She told stories of anti-war rallies and chants ("Ho ho, Ho Chi Minh is gonna win") and about her cousins who left pieces of their bodies and their minds in a foreign land. 

In an attempt to educate ourselves, we took a speedboat to the Cu Chi tunnels where tourists are invited to crawl through several meters of underground tunnels used by the Vietnamese to thwart opposing forces. You can see the guts of an American tank, various types of Vietnamese traps, and mannequin-adorned dioramas of daily life during the war. The Vietnamese were downright thrifty - fashioning shoes out of car tires and inner tubes, and re-using abandoned American equipment. They camped out in the woods, hammocks slung between trees. Dead soldiers have been found resting in their hammocks, 60 feet off the ground as the trees continued to grow.

We were warned that the tour came with a propaganda video full of anti-American sentiment, but instead we found a level headed tour guide who explained that, in the end, there were no winners. 

After 3 days in Siagon, we were ready to move on. The plan was to trace the coastline on our way north, but Vietnam had a big surprise: TÃ©t. Asian countries celebrate the Lunar New Year as their biggest holiday of the year, and Vietnam's was bearing down on us. We knew in advance it was happening but we didn't know that for one week, transportation is impossible and everything is closed. We discovered that there wasn't a single domestic bus, train, or plane ticket available - they had all sold out months ago.  We had the option to hire a private car which would get us to our first stop, but there was no guarantee of further transportation until the holiday ended. We decided to take matters into our own hands.  Enter Mini Mao, or as I liked to call him, "A Goddamn Miracle".

While scouring the internet for escape options, I came across a Craigslist posting, scrawled in terrible English, offering a Honda Win 100c motorbike for $250. It came with helmets, a luggage rack, and most importantly, a working horn. It turned out that the bike was owned by a French photographer who had just made the journey from Hanoi. I withdrew just over 3 million Vietnamese Dong from the closest ATM and secured our ticket out of town.
